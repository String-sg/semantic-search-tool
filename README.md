# Semantic Search (Chemistry, Repository of Teaching Resources)

Developed by: Chan Kuang Wen (Raffles Institution)
Documentation by: Kahhow

### How it works<br>
1) Videos are transcribed into text with corresponding timestamps so it can be queried. <br>
2) Upon user input, semantic search is applied - blocks of texts are converted into text embeddings (represented as a vector/ array). <br>
3) Output: YouTube videos (personal respository of self-filmed Chemistry teaching videos)
